## 📄 【English Introduction】
  Hello everyone! I'm a beginner in Java, and this is a project I developed independently. It was inspired by one of my favorite platforms from childhood, and my goal is to recreate it as a tribute. This has become a strong motivation for me to learn and grow through development.

  This project is purely for personal enjoyment and has no commercial purpose. If it unintentionally infringes on any copyright or intellectual property rights, please let me know as soon as possible—I will take immediate action to address and correct it. Thank you for your understanding and kind guidance!
